Compared to normalized scientific notation, one disadvantage of using
SI prefixes and engineering notation is that significant figures are
not always readily apparent when the smallest significant digit or
digits are 0. For example, 500 microns (micrometers) and $500\times\;10^{-6}$
meters cannot express the uncertainty distinctions between



$5\times10^{-4}$ meters, $5.0\times10^{-4}$ meters, and
$5.00\times10^{-4}$ meters.  This can be solved by changing the range
of the coefficient in front of the power from the common 1  --  1000 to
0.001 --  1.0.  In some cases this may be suitable; in others it may be
impractical. In the previous example, 0.5 mm, 0.50 mm, or 0.500 mm
would have been used to show uncertainty and significant figures. It
is also common to state the precision explicitly, such as "47 kilo
ohms $\pm$ 5\%.




Another example: when the speed of light (exactly 299792458 meters/sec by the
definition of the meter) is expressed as $3.00\times10^8$ meters/sec.
or $3.00\times10^5$ kilometers/sec.  then it is clear that it is
between 299500 km/sec and 300500 kilometers/sec, but when using $300\times10^6$
meters/sec or $300\times10^3$ kilometers/sec, this is not the case.






Engineering notation, like scientific notation generally, can use the
E-notation, such that $3.0\times10^{-9}$ meters/sec can be written
3.0E-9 or 3.0e-9.  The E (or e) should not be confused with the
exponential e which holds a completely different significance.
